MVP
- how to do wpm calculations
- key down/up events sent via WS
- init 1 player lobby via WS
- home page: start lobby, or just start game
- upgrade to WS? react ws stuff
- word bank on backend, plus can upload their own
- unselectable text, each keystroke is sent via WS
- live wpm updates on frontend?
- accuracy score as well
- on play, backend sends text to type -> display some amount of it

Multiplayer
- lobbies to n players
- websocket lobby, same as 1p but logically grouped
- send updates about other players ( progress bar )
- on finish determine placement -> notify

Logistics
- vite/node to serve frontend
- monolithic for now, node and go hosted on same machine on different ports
- docker to compose both services together
- uhh what else...
